## Key Technical Decisions
1. **Supabase** for backend - provides auth, database, and real-time capabilities
2. **Flutter** for cross-platform mobile development
3. **GoRouter** for navigation with deep linking support
4. **Row Level Security (RLS)** for data protection
5. **Local cart storage** for offline capability

## Development Commands
```bash
# Run the app
flutter run

# Run tests
flutter test

# Build for production
flutter build apk --release  # Android
flutter build ios --release  # iOS

# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean && flutter pub get
```

## Database Management
- Run SQL scripts in Supabase dashboard
- **Applied Scripts (Demo Mode Active)**:
  - âœ… `disable_rls_simple.sql` - RLS disabled for development
  - âœ… `remove_foreign_key_constraint.sql` - Allows demo user creation
- **Ready for Production**:
  - `production_rls_setup.sql` - Complete security implementation
  - `cleanup_category_mappings.sql` - Database optimization
- **Documentation**:
  - `docs/PRODUCTION_SECURITY.md` - Security implementation guide
  - `docs/USER_MANAGEMENT_DESIGN.md` - User system architecture

## Contributing Guidelines
1. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
2. Test thoroughly before committing
3. Update documentation for significant changes
4. Use meaningful commit messages
5. Create feature branches for new development
